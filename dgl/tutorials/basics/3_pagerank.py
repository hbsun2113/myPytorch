PageRank with DGL Message Passing
=================================

**Author**: `Minjie Wang <https://jermainewang.github.io/>`_, Quan Gan, Yu Gai,
Zheng Zhang

In this section we illustrate the usage of different levels of message
passing API with PageRank on a small graph. In DGL, the message passing and
feature transformations are all **User-Defined Functions** (UDFs).

The goal of this tutorial: to implement PageRank using DGL message passing
interface.

# The PageRank Algorithm
# ----------------------
# In each iteration of PageRank, every node (web page) first scatters its
# PageRank value uniformly to its downstream nodes. The new PageRank value of
# each node is computed by aggregating the received PageRank values from its
# neighbors, which is then adjusted by the damping factor:
#
# .. math::
#
#    PV(u) = \frac{1-d}{N} + d \times \sum_{v \in \mathcal{N}(u)}
#    \frac{PV(v)}{D(v)}
#
# where :math:`N` is the number of nodes in the graph; :math:`D(v)` is the
# out-degree of a node :math:`v`; and :math:`\mathcal{N}(u)` is the neighbor
# nodes.


###############################################################################
# A naive implementation
# ----------------------
# Let us first create a graph with 100 nodes with NetworkX and convert it to a
# :class:`DGLGraph`:

import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import torch
import dgl

N = 100  # number of nodes
DAMP = 0.85  # damping factor
K = 10  # number of iterations
g = nx.nx.erdos_renyi_graph(N, 0.1)
g = dgl.DGLGraph(g)
nx.draw(g.to_networkx(), node_size=50, node_color=[[.5, .5, .5,]])
plt.show()


###############################################################################
# According to the algorithm, PageRank consists of two phases in a typical
# scatter-gather pattern. We first initialize the PageRank value of each node
# to :math:`\frac{1}{N}` and store each node's out-degree as a node feature:

g.ndata['pv'] = torch.ones(N) / N
g.ndata['deg'] = g.out_degrees(g.nodes()).float()


###############################################################################
# We then define the message function, which divides every node's PageRank
# value by its out-degree and passes the result as message to its neighbors:

def pagerank_message_func(edges):
    return {'pv' : edges.src['pv'] / edges.src['deg']}


###############################################################################
# In DGL, the message functions are expressed as **Edge UDFs**.  Edge UDFs
# take in a single argument ``edges``.  It has three members ``src``, ``dst``,
# and ``data`` for accessing source node features, destination node features,
# and edge features respectively.  Here, the function computes messages only
# from source node features.
#
# Next, we define the reduce function, which removes and aggregates the
# messages from its ``mailbox``, and computes its new PageRank value:

def pagerank_reduce_func(nodes):
    msgs = torch.sum(nodes.mailbox['pv'], dim=1)
    pv = (1 - DAMP) / N + DAMP * msgs
    return {'pv' : pv}


###############################################################################
# The reduce functions are **Node UDFs**.  Node UDFs have a single argument
# ``nodes``, which has two members ``data`` and ``mailbox``.  ``data``
# contains the node features while ``mailbox`` contains all incoming message
# features, stacked along the second dimension (hence the ``dim=1`` argument).
#
# The message UDF works on a batch of edges, whereas the reduce UDF works on
# a batch of edges but outputs a batch of nodes. Their relationships are as
# follows:
#
# .. image:: https://i.imgur.com/kIMiuFb.png
#
# We register the message function and reduce function, which will be called
# later by DGL.

g.register_message_func(pagerank_message_func)
g.register_reduce_func(pagerank_reduce_func)


###############################################################################
# The algorithm is then very straight-forward. Here is the code for one
# PageRank iteration:

def pagerank_naive(g):
    # Phase #1: send out messages along all edges.
    for u, v in zip(*g.edges()):
        g.send((u, v))
    # Phase #2: receive messages to compute new PageRank values.
    for v in g.nodes():
        g.recv(v)


###############################################################################
# Improvement with batching semantics
# -----------------------------------
# The above code does not scale to large graph because it iterates over all
# the nodes. DGL solves this by letting user compute on a *batch* of nodes or
# edges. For example, the following codes trigger message and reduce functions
# on multiple nodes and edges at once.

def pagerank_batch(g):
    g.send(g.edges())
    g.recv(g.nodes())


###############################################################################
# Note that we are still using the same reduce function ``pagerank_reduce_func``,
# where ``nodes.mailbox['pv']`` is a *single* tensor, stacking the incoming
# messages along the second dimension.
#
# Naturally, one will wonder if this is even possible to perform reduce on all
# nodes in parallel, since each node may have different number of incoming
# messages and one cannot really "stack" tensors of different lengths together.
# In general, DGL solves the problem by grouping the nodes by the number of
# incoming messages, and calling the reduce function for each group.


###############################################################################
# More improvement with higher level APIs
# ---------------------------------------
# DGL provides many routines that combines basic ``send`` and ``recv`` in
# various ways. They are called **level-2 APIs**. For example, the PageRank
# example can be further simplified as follows:

def pagerank_level2(g):
    g.update_all()


###############################################################################
# Besides ``update_all``, we also have ``pull``, ``push``, and ``send_and_recv``
# in this level-2 category. Please refer to the :doc:`API reference <../../api/python/graph>`
# for more details.


###############################################################################
# Even more improvement with DGL builtin functions
# ------------------------------------------------
# As some of the message and reduce functions are very commonly used, DGL also
# provides **builtin functions**. For example, two builtin functions can be
# used in the PageRank example.
#
# * :func:`dgl.function.copy_src(src, out) <function.copy_src>`
#   is an edge UDF that computes the
#   output using the source node feature data. User needs to specify the name of
#   the source feature data (``src``) and the output name (``out``).
# 
# * :func:`dgl.function.sum(msg, out) <function.sum>` is a node UDF
#   that sums the messages in
#   the node's mailbox. User needs to specify the message name (``msg``) and the
#   output name (``out``).
#
# For example, the PageRank example can be rewritten as following:

import dgl.function as fn

def pagerank_builtin(g):
    g.ndata['pv'] = g.ndata['pv'] / g.ndata['deg']
    g.update_all(message_func=fn.copy_src(src='pv', out='m'),
                 reduce_func=fn.sum(msg='m',out='m_sum'))
    g.ndata['pv'] = (1 - DAMP) / N + DAMP * g.ndata['m_sum']


###############################################################################
# Here, we directly provide the UDFs to the :func:`update_all <DGLGraph.update_all>`
# as its arguments.
# This will override the previously registered UDFs.
#
# In addition to cleaner code, using builtin functions also gives DGL the
# opportunity to fuse operations together, resulting in faster execution.  For
# example, DGL will fuse the ``copy_src`` message function and ``sum`` reduce
# function into one sparse matrix-vector (spMV) multiplication.
#
# `This section <spmv_>`_ describes why spMV can speed up the scatter-gather
# phase in PageRank.  For more details about the builtin functions in DGL,
# please read the :doc:`API reference <../../api/python/function>`.
#
# You can also download and run the codes to feel the difference.

for k in range(K):
    # Uncomment the corresponding line to select different version.
    # pagerank_naive(g)
    # pagerank_batch(g)
    # pagerank_level2(g)
    pagerank_builtin(g)
print(g.ndata['pv'])


###############################################################################
# .. _spmv:
#
# Using spMV for PageRank
# -----------------------
# Using builtin functions allows DGL to understand the semantics of UDFs and
# thus allows more efficient implementation for you. For example, in the case
# of PageRank, one common trick to accelerate it is using its linear algebra
# form.
#
# .. math::
#
#    \mathbf{R}^{k} = \frac{1-d}{N} \mathbf{1} + d \mathbf{A}*\mathbf{R}^{k-1}
#
# Here, :math:`\mathbf{R}^k` is the vector of the PageRank values of all nodes
# at iteration :math:`k`; :math:`\mathbf{A}` is the sparse adjacency matrix
# of the graph.
# Computing this equation is quite efficient because there exists efficient
# GPU kernel for the *sparse-matrix-vector-multiplication* (spMV). DGL
# detects whether such optimization is available through the builtin
# functions. If the certain combination of builtins can be mapped to a spMV
# kernel (e.g. the pagerank example), DGL will use it automatically. As a
# result, *we recommend using builtin functions whenever it is possible*.
