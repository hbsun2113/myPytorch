Graph Neural Network and its variant
====================================

* **GCN** `[paper] <https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907>`__ `[tutorial]
  <1_gnn/1_gcn.html>`__ `[Pytorch code]
  <https://github.com/dmlc/dgl/blob/master/examples/pytorch/gcn>`__
  `[MXNet code]
  <https://github.com/dmlc/dgl/tree/master/examples/mxnet/gcn>`__:
  this is the vanilla GCN. The tutorial covers the basic uses of DGL APIs.

* **GAT** `[paper] <https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10903>`__ `[Pytorch code]
  <https://github.com/dmlc/dgl/blob/master/examples/pytorch/gat>`__
  `[MXNet code]
  <https://github.com/dmlc/dgl/tree/master/examples/mxnet/gat>`__:
  the key extension of GAT w.r.t vanilla GCN is deploying multi-head attention
  among neighborhood of a node, thus greatly enhances the capacity and
  expressiveness of the model.

* **R-GCN** `[paper] <https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06103>`__ `[tutorial]
  <1_gnn/4_rgcn.html>`__ `[Pytorch code]
  <https://github.com/dmlc/dgl/tree/master/examples/pytorch/rgcn>`__
  `[MXNet code]
  <https://github.com/dmlc/dgl/tree/master/examples/mxnet/rgcn>`__:
  the key difference of RGNN is to allow multi-edges among two entities of a
  graph, and edges with distinct relationships are encoded differently. This
  is an interesting extension of GCN that can have a lot of applications of
  its own.

* **LGNN** `[paper] <https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08415>`__ `[tutorial]
  <1_gnn/6_line_graph.html>`__ `[Pytorch code]
  <https://github.com/dmlc/dgl/tree/master/examples/pytorch/line_graph>`__:
  this model focuses on community detection by inspecting graph structures. It
  uses representations of both the original graph and its line-graph
  companion. In addition to demonstrate how an algorithm can harness multiple
  graphs, our implementation shows how one can judiciously mix vanilla tensor
  operation, sparse-matrix tensor operations, along with message-passing with
  DGL.

* **SSE** `[paper] <http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/dai18a/dai18a.pdf>`__ `[tutorial]
  <1_gnn/8_sse_mx.html>`__ `[MXNet code]
  <https://github.com/dmlc/dgl/blob/master/examples/mxnet/sse>`__:
  the emphasize here is *giant* graph that cannot fit comfortably on one GPU
  card. SSE is an example to illustrate the co-design of both algorithm and
  system: sampling to guarantee asymptotic convergence while lowering the
  complexity, and batching across samples for maximum parallelism.
