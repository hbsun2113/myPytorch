    '''Create a sampler that samples neighborhood.

    This creates a subgraph data loader that samples subgraphs from the input graph
    with neighbor sampling. This sampling method is implemented in C and can perform
    sampling very efficiently.
    
    A subgraph grows from a seed vertex. It contains sampled neighbors
    of the seed vertex as well as the edges that connect neighbor nodes with
    seed nodes. When the number of hops is k (>1), the neighbors are sampled
    from the k-hop neighborhood. In this case, the sampled edges are the ones
    that connect the source nodes and the sampled neighbor nodes of the source
    nodes.

    The subgraph loader returns a list of subgraphs and a dictionary of additional
    information about the subgraphs. The size of the subgraph list is the number of workers.

    The dictionary contains:

    - seeds: a list of 1D tensors of seed Ids, if return_seed_id is True.

    Parameters
    ----------
    g: the DGLGraph where we sample subgraphs.
    batch_size: The number of subgraphs in a batch.
    expand_factor: the number of neighbors sampled from the neighbor list
        of a vertex. The value of this parameter can be
        an integer: indicates the number of neighbors sampled from a neighbor list.
        a floating-point: indicates the ratio of the sampled neighbors in a neighbor list.
        string: indicates some common ways of calculating the number of sampled neighbors,
        e.g., 'sqrt(deg)'.
    num_hops: The size of the neighborhood where we sample vertices.
    neighbor_type: indicates the neighbors on different types of edges.
        "in" means the neighbors on the in-edges, "out" means the neighbors on
        the out-edges and "both" means neighbors on both types of edges.
    node_prob: the probability that a neighbor node is sampled.
        1D Tensor. None means uniform sampling. Otherwise, the number of elements
        should be the same as the number of vertices in the graph.
    seed_nodes: a list of nodes where we sample subgraphs from.
        If it's None, the seed vertices are all vertices in the graph.
    shuffle: indicates the sampled subgraphs are shuffled.
    num_workers: the number of worker threads that sample subgraphs in parallel.
    return_seed_id: indicates whether to return seed ids along with the subgraphs.
        The seed Ids are in the parent graph.
    prefetch : bool, default False
        Whether to prefetch the samples in the next batch.

    Returns
    -------
    A subgraph iterator
        The iterator returns a list of batched subgraphs and a dictionary of additional
        information about the subgraphs.
